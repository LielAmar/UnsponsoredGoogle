# About

This project is a very simple chrome extension which removes sponsored sections from google search. It had become very annoying to use google search due to the large number of sponsored ads at the top of the screen, sometimes having up to 4 ads. This causes users to have to scroll down in order to view actual, unsponsored, websites.

This extension simply removes all sponsored blocks. It is not widely tested and might not work 100% of times, but it's something :)

## Installation
To install this extension, clone this repository and follow these steps:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable `Develper Mode`
3. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder containing the code
4. Enjoy!
